# Changes in wealth across the life course in birth cohorts from five low- and middle-income countries

**Background:**    
Temporally-harmonized asset-based measures of wealth can be used to study the association of life course wealth exposures with health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. The longitudinal stability of asset-based indices in cohort settings is poorly understood.    

**Methods:**    
Using data from five birth cohorts from three continents, we develop temporally-harmonized asset indices over the life course through polychoric principal component analysis of a consistently collected set of assets. For each cohort, we compare harmonized index to cross-sectional indices created using more comprehensive asset measures using rank correlations. We evaluate the correlation of the harmonized index in early life and adulthood with maternal schooling and attained schooling, respectively.
